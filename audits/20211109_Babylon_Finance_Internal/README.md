**Critical** severity issues need to be fixed as soon as possible. They are usually allowing a drastic reduction of the balance of the system or their users' without consent, they put in danger the whole integrity of the system or they can even stuck the whole system stopping it from normal and expected functioning. They damage and impact the future of the whole system and its brand reputation.

**Medium** severity issues could potentially bring problems and should eventually be fixed.
